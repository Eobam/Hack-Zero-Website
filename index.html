<h3>Types of projects:</h3>
<p>You can make basically anything that relates to a Flipper Zero. You can make an app, a screen extension, a new sensor, basically anything. The one thing I am currently banning, is cases with no new functions, this can be up for discussion, but I don't really think just a CAD model is sufficent.</p>

<h2>What's a Flipper Zero?</h2>
<p>A Flipper Zero is a palm-sized multi-tool device for pentesters, developers, and computer enthusiasts. It has a wide variety of features, including a 1 GHZ transciever, RFID and NFC capabilities, Bluetooth features, hardware debugging, a cute dolphin and much more. What we really care about, is the GPIO pins, and the ability to create apps. The Flipper Zero allows us to add extra sensors, and applications with the existing one easily. More information, and guides on this can be found in the <a href="guides.html" style="color: grey;"> guides section</a></p>
